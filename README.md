## International Show Times, Task

**Author**: Fudayl Cavus<br />
**Crawled Website Count**: 7/6<br />
**Crawl-E Version**: v0.5.1
<br />

### Important Note
To understand the `crawl-e library` thoroughly, 
I began with easier tasks and gradually progressed to more challenging ones.  <br />

Once I felt comfortable with the library, I decided to crawl the hardest website instead of the easier ones because I felt that investing effort in the easier tasks would be unproductive or futile.

<sup>`https://www.cinesa.es/` wasn't working properly so chose the second hardest</sup>
